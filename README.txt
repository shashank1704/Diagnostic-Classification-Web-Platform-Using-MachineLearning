**Diagnostic and Classification Web Application**
Overview
This project is a web application designed for diagnostic and classification tasks using 
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. The application allows 
users to predict various health conditions like heart disease and diabetes, classify 
images, detect faces, and determine whether a text is spam or not. The interface is 
user-friendly, requiring a simple login with a username and password.
Features
• User Authentication: Secure login system with username and password.
• Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on 
input features.
• Diabetes Prediction: Evaluates the risk of diabetes using user-provided data.
• Spam Detection: Classifies text as spam or not spam.
• Image Classification: Classifies images into predefined categories.
• Face Detection: Identifies and detects faces in an image.
• Chatbot: Integrated chatbot for user support and interaction.
Tech Stack
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Backend: Flask (Python)
• Machine Learning/Deep Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
• Database: SQLite (or any other database you're using)
• Hosting: Localhost or any cloud platform (if deployed)
